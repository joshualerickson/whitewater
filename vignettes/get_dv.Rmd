## Intro  

The whitewater package has a flow to it and that flow starts with `ww_dvUSGS()`. In this vignette we'll go over the advantages of using `ww_dvUSGS()` first but also how it's not necessary.  

## Flow  

The main flow in whitewater is to start with `ww_dvUSGS()` and then use that object for further filtering. We'll start with just getting daily values of water data.  
```{r setup}
library(whitewater)
```
